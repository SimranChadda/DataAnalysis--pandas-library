# Pandas Library

Pandas is another Data Analysis Library which is built on top of Numpy Library. 

Some of the features that Pandas provide-

1. Pandas is an open-source library.
2. Allows for fast fast analysis & data cleaning & data preparation.
3. Excels in performance & productivity.
4. Also, has built-in visualization features.
5. can work with data from a wide variety of sources.

In Pandas package, there are two data structures- series and dataframes.

Here, you will have a deep understanding of -

BASIC PANDAS AND DATA WRANGLING

1. Series Basics and its creating techniques
2. DataFrames Basics and its creating techniques
3. DataFrames Basics- Reading Datasets examples
4. Basic Data Wrangling- the process of transforming raw data to a clean and organized format ready for use. For us, data wrangling is only one step in preprocessing our data, but it is an important step.

ADVANCED PANDAS AND DATA WRANGLING (with real datasets)

1. Series and DataFrames
2. DataFrames- Reading Datasets examples
3. Data Wrangling

Along with my notes, you can always refer to Pandas Cheat Sheet for better understanding!

Happy Learning!
